Hi there! ❤️ This is Ash, a computer science student from Toronto, Canada. 🎓 My interests lie in machine learning, data science, and software engineering! I enjoy participating in tech conferences, hackathons, and personal projects.

Hoping for more diversity in STEM, this GitHub is a starting point to goals being achieved. HerStoryBytes will include snippets of code I create or am inspired by throughout this coding journey. It will showcase the vast amount of growth that emerges to one that undergoes the coder era. 👩🏽‍💻🧠

Outside of work and school, I'm interested in following currect tech trends, science development, and how AI is changing the world in a better way!

Please Note: This repository is currently in-progress as I am hoping to add some other projects on here as well. It will soon be completed!
